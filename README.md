Vertical scaling (scaling up) usually involves increasing the resources (CPU, RAM, etc.) of a single machine, which is managed at the infrastructure level (e.g., through a cloud provider). However, in Node.js, vertical scaling is typically simulated by taking full advantage of all CPU cores using the built-in cluster module.

Here's a basic example of vertical scaling in Node.js using the cluster module:

ðŸ§  Concept:
Node.js is single-threaded by default. Using cluster, we can fork the process to use multiple CPU cores â€” essentially doing vertical scaling at the application level.
v\ðŸ“Œ Notes:
This is not true vertical scaling (like resizing a VM), but it's the closest you get in Node.js.

For horizontal scaling (across multiple machines), you'd use a load balancer and deploy multiple instances.

Be careful with shared state between workers â€” use inter-process communication or external services (e.g., Redis, DB).
